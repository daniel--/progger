Progger

In Progger you command the unlikely hero of a giant planet sized frog trying to reach his brethren on planet Earth.
Along the way you hitch a ride on some delicious space potatoes and the gravitational fields of (in)conveniently placed planets. 
On each level your goal is to reach the green circle thus transporting to the next level.
